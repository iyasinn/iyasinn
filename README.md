I’m a coder with a passion for:
- **C++**: Where performance meets elegance
- **Research**: Forever curious, forever exploring
- **ML**: Turning data into insights (and maybe magic!)
- **Systems**: Crafting robust and efficient architectures

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, world of C++, Research, ML, and Systems!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
